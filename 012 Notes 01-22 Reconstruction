South after Civil War
	1870 - Census computed that blacks made about 40\% of the per capita income
		But only 12\% of total wealth
	Capital resources are completely gone

Reconstruction
	Two themes
		Presidency trying to reestablish the union
		Congress trying to change the south forever
	A new proclamation
		Property, with the exception of slavery, will be restored
		Confederate states must acknoledge the Emancipation Proclamation before reentering the union
		Louisiana and Arkansas do this in due time
	Lincoln is becoming completely dominant at this time
		Makes his staff sign a paper stating that they will allow the government to change to Democrats should the Republicans lose the election

Arkansas congressmen show up to congress asking for a seat
	Congress not required to seat them
	Refused to seat them
	Criticized Lincoln on how he pocket vetoed the wayne-davis bill
	When congress resumes in the winter session, they pass the 13th ammendment
		Not ratified until December 1865
		Takes a year

Freedman's Bureau established
	Known officially as something much longer
	Oliver Otis Howard
	Monitor condition of freedmen
	Provide food and clothing to the poor southerners (applies to whites as well)
	Given very little money
	Only exists for one year

Johnson Takes Over
	Democrat serving in congress
	Believes even more than Lincoln in limited government
	Picks up Lincoln's plan
		Issues the Johnson Plan
			Very similar to Lincoln's plan
		Requires 10\% of the population to reswear
		General amnesty for everyone except 14 high classes of southerners
	Allows for pardons of the higher officers if they come in person
		Pardons 13000 of them

Black Codes passed
	Some of them obvious
		Can marry
		Can own property
		Can testify in courts (but not against whites)
	Others limit rights
		Forced to work
	Leads to a weakened form of slavery
	Convinces northerners that southerners don't understand that the north won the war

Near the end of the war, some southerners realize that slavery won't survive the war
	Serious proposals starting 1863 to emancipate slavery in the confederate states

Manifestation of racism
	Violence breaks out against freedmen for random and unreasonable reasons

Level of violence in south against freedmen rising continually
	Weekly, if not daily, murders of freedmen

New Orleans Riots
	Huge loss of popularity for Johnson

Rise of the southern Republican party
	Most of the blacks voted republican (no surprise)
	A few blacks elected to congress

By 1867, A fullscale white offensive to take back control has been launched

Contest between Johnson and Congress over the department of war
	Johnson asks for Stanton to resign
	Stanton refuses
	Eventually Johnson fires him
	Stanton refuses to leave
	The next year, congress reaffirms Stanton
	Johnson appoints U. S. Grant
	Congress refuses to recognize Grant
	Johnson alienates himself from congress

Republicans in the House impeaches him
	14 charges
	Not removed from office in senate because 7 republicans cross party lines
	Usually congress does voice voting
	Sometimes a record vote
		Rare and time consuming in which everyone must sign how they vote
		Done in impeachment trial of Johnson
	Vote fails by 1

When Johnson leaves office, only 5 states allow blacks for vote
	More states try, but they all fail

Election of 1868
	Republicans turn to a sure candidate - Ulysses S. Grant
	Democrats nominate a rather reluctant candidate - oops I missed who it was
	epublicans win
