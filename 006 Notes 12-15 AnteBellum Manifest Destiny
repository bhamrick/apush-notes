	Webster-Ashburton treaty
	John O'Sullivan
		Makes a speech to a bunch of women
		Uses the term ``Manifest Destiny'' a lot
	Election of 1840
	Disastrous administration of Tyler

	Annexation of Texas
		Tyler attempting to use it as an excuse for staying in politics
		Doesn't work
	Election of 1844
		James K Polk elected
		Annexation of Texas shortly follows
		Politicians don't realize that public opinion has swung in favor of Manifest Destiny
		Van Buren shows up with support
		Democratic party requires 2/3 majority to obtain nomination
		This gives other politicians a chance to get it such as Polk
		Polk is generally regarded as the first dark horse
		Polk
			Expansionist
			Runs as an expansionist
			Whigs don't catch on to the fad quick enough
			Clay eventually puts out a letter saying he endorses the annexation
				Viewed as an `accommodater'
			``54-40 or fight''
		Continued Liberty party which started in 1840
			Gets more votes this time
			Draws votes away from the Whig mainly since abolitionists would have voted Whig
	Polk Administration
		Annexes Texas and Oregon
		Massive foreign issues with Great Britain and Mexico
		Sends Buchanan to make a treaty: Buchanan-Packenham Treaty
		Instead of 54-40, 49th parallel
		Pig war at Oregon 49th parallel (1859)
			A Canadian pig breaks out and eats American potatoes
			Americans convert pig to bacon
			Britain and United States send troops
			Lead to a standoff
			Doesn't actually lead to conflict
		Also sends an emissary to Mexico City
			Attempt to purchase Alta California
			Trade with China is getting increasingly profitable
			Opium wars
				Britain shuts down Chinese resistance to trade
				Opens up China
				Notable one is Treaty of Won Jia (spelled variously, probably wrong here)
		Push to lower tariff
		Promises a significant point in Harpersville
		Manifest Destiny becomes more significant in his policies after election
			Never follows through with his promise to improve tariff
	Wilmot proviso
		Polk gets to have the war
		Can't have the institution of slavery in any new states from the war
		Leads to a division in Congress

		All southerners (both Whigs and Democrats) vote against it
