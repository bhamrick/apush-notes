	23 - 33 Pet banks receive that money
	Secretary refuses to comply, Jackson pulls out his resignation letter, and he is allowed to resign.
	The replacement simply doesn't do it, and he, too, ``resigns''
	Jackson turns to Roger B Tauny/Tany who actually does it.
	Pet banks immediately start printing moneys
	Congress refuses to regulate the pet banks
