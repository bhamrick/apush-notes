	Then, May 1915 brings the sinking of the Lusitania
		German embassy gives a warning to all travellers that going on this ship will be a risk.
		Then the ship is sunk
	The Arabic is sunk sometime later
		Germany had given its U-boat commanders a secret order to not sink large passenger ships
		Germany then issues publically the Arabic Pledge after the incident.
			Will not sink large nonmilitary ships without 30 minutes warning.
	Germany agrees to end this U-boat warfare under the condition that the US gets the embargo on nonmilitary goods lifted (i.e. food)
	Opposition to the war lead by progressives
	US Economy booms due to the war
		Most of the exports by a large margin go to Great Britain and France

	Wilson runs his 1916 campaign on the issue of keeping the US out of war.
		He wins the election because of it
	Wilson tries to arbitrate an end to the war
		Gets nowhere, partially because some of the powers smell victory
	After that, he tries to get people to accept a peace without victory - makes sense
		Doesn't get anywhere either
	African Americans serve about as much as whites in the war
