Slavery
	Deep South
		Mainly cotton growing
	All of the talent that would come out of the south comes out in slaves
	Benefits the south because of 3/5 clause
		Slaves count as citizens but can't vote
	Dissension in south over slavery
	Small cabins housing many people
	Slave Rebellions
		Very few of them - whites have the guns and the punishment is swift and harsh
		Nat Turner
			Very charismatic slave who escapes from his owner and remains at large for 6 years
			Has a vision - battle between white angels and black angels
			Signals a general uprising
			Raises 50 follows, kills 60-70 plantation owners
			Put into the press everywhere
			200 slaves are ``tried'' and executed
				Mostly innocent
			A local doctor interviews Nat Turner
				Publishes ``Confessions of Nat Turner''
				Drives south further into the defensive crouch
		Movements in the south to abolish slavery
			Every one of them fails, but Virginia's was close
			Even so, they did have the vote, which is important
			Gradually they decline, starting around 1830
	A few slaves escape, but not many
		Underground railroad exists
		Probably most people involved were blacks
	Box Brown - 1850
		Gets himself shipped north in a box
	Slave codes
		More repressive every time
		Not effective
	Cassius Marcellus Clay
		Born as the son of a Kentucky slave owner
		Later became a strong advocate of gradual abolitionism
	``Impending Crisis of the South''
		The South, tied to cotton, is headed to economic disaster
	Dixie
Manufacturing
	Mainly north
	What happens in south is primary manufacturing
	Exeption: Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, VA
		4th largest Iron Works in the US
	1835: Prattville
	Southern mechanization is preempted by cotton
Election of 1848
	Zachary Taylor comes to office
	Oregon is already in the union under Polk
	California soon joins
	South loses control in House, but still has blocking power in senate
	Congress is the power that decides what the terms are for states entering the union
	California is clearly going to be a free state
	What about New Mexico? Not nearly as clear
	Can't really think that slavery will go into either
		Don't have the suitable conditions for growing cotton
	Southern "Fire-Eaters"
	Calhoun calls for a southern convention in Nashville in 1850
	Simultaneously, there is the issue of the speaker of the house
	Clay puts together a compromise (Compromise of 1850)
		California will come in as a free state
		Utah and New Mexico will have no restrictions
		Texas will get money to pay off the bonds
		Disputed border between Utah and Texas will be resolved
Millard Filmore takes the Presidency
	Whig
	12th president
	The leaving of Calhoun, Webster, and one other guy really causes a lack of union feeling
Stephen A. Douglas
