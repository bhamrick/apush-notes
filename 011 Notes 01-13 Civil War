Foreign Affairs
	Raiders, Trent incident, alternative cotton sources
	Confederacy gets the Layard shipyard to put together huge warships
		Layerd rams - Huge guns
		However, they get confined
	Napoleon III
		Uses sale of Mexican bonds to Europe to establish a French empire
		When Mexico can't pay debts, he puts together an expedition to Mexico
		Maximillian becomes Emperor of Mexico in return for role in government
	USA has sent notes saying that this is regarded as an unfriendly act
		Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, marches troops to the Mexican border
		Napoleon retreats his troops, but Maximillian decides to stay
		He eventually gets surrounded and executed
	Why don't Great Britain and France join the war?
		No decisive Southern or Northern victories
		Some small ones, but nothing worth entering for
		King Cotton turns out worthless
			Blockade makes it impossible for trade anyway
Technology
	Improvements to the musket
		Claude Minie
		Rifles get introduced
		Small grooves which give the slug a spin
			Improve accuracy by a bunch
			Triple the range at which you can reliably hit a target
			Even at half a mile if you're good
	Improvements to artillery
		About the same improvement as rifle over musket
	Mobility is still mostly foot
		Cavalry is essentially negated by the rifles
		Shooting works just as well on a fast opponent now
South's Strategy
	Nobody in the South believes in victory
	The goal is to convince the North to let them go
	Options are to make it unbearably painful or get external support
		External support is unlikely
	How to make it painful
		Drag out the war? Not going to work so well
		Better is to attack where you have tactical advantagy
		Win key battles, not every battle
		Doesn't work due to technological reasons
North's Strategy
	Anaconda Strategy (Winfield Scott)
		Surround the south and starve them
		Western-oriented strategy
	Minimize losses, prevent unnecessary casualties
	Both sides attempt to seize the other capital to lower morale
Sort-of Turning Points
	Antietam - Lee almost loses the entire army, foreign support possibilities disappear
	Gettysburg - Popularized as high point in South in many books
		Lee wrecks his army here
Military stuff
	First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas)
		McDowell comes down and meets the South guarding Bull Run Creek
		Feints to South, sends main force to the North
		Northern force spotted, so it was delayed long enough to establish defensive position
		Everyone wearing the same color, can't tell anyone apart
		Federal troops drive up Henry Hill
		Stonewall Jackson stands at the top of the hill and gets a counterattack
		South gets pushed back until reinforcements arrive
		First significant Southern victory
		At this point, people realize that the war will be hard 
	Ball's Bluff 20-21 October 1861
		Lincoln convinces McClullen to make an offensive attack
		Bodies fall into the river and wash past Washington - a huge embarrassment
		After this, Union will never take a significant risk in battle
	The Battle of Hampton Roads
		Union Intelligence indicates that the South has fitted out an ironclad
		The ironclad Monitor is put together and moves down to deal with it
		Because the battle was a standoff, blockade is not broken
		Monitor only attacks with half force
	Battle at Shiloh
		The casualties here are massive - larger than all the previous US wars
	Second Battle of Bull Run
		Flank by South that decimates the Northern troops
		Battle of Chantilly occurs as the attempt to stop the retreat is detected
		Lee determines now to invade the North
		Lee defeats the union forces which come to him because they come one at a time instead of all at once
	Lee pushes into Maryland - Harper's Ferry
		Tries to get people to rally around the Confederate Flag
		Doesn't happen because they are Western Marylanders and not pro-slavery
		McClullen gets intelligence about Lee's orders
		Checks intelligence for too long, when he does move it's too late
Emancipation Proclamation 1863
	Shifts war to a higher plane
	To be effective the beginning of the next year
	Drafted before Antietam, but not passed until afterward
	Applies only to slave states in rebellion
	Not until 13th ammendment that all slaves are freed
	Gives the south time to give up before they have to lose their slaves
	By the end of the war, about a third of slaves liberate themselves
Slaves
	At first not used in the war
	Thought that they can't be adequately trained
	Eventually they are used about they use white troops
	Starting June 1864, they start being used more
	Blacks suffer higher casualty rates
		South fights quite hard and kills blacks when they are defeated
		Garrison duty, mostly, which is less healthy than being on the field due to disease
Land Grant
	Acreage given to states for the establishment of higher education institutions
North establishing new territories in the west
United States Sanitary Commission
	Civilian support for the war
