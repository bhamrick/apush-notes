Most of the Republicans in the south are freedmen
	Will vote in good numbers for the Republicans until violence breaks out

Election of 1868
	Ulysses S. Grant
	Shift to monetary policy which reflects Republicans walking away from working class
	Response to flood of greenbacks
	Problem of Gilded age
		Easy money or hard money
	Idea that money's value is based on the backing by hard specie (gold/silver)
	Problem: As west is explored, new sources of gold and silver are found
		Ratio of specie to greenback must be adjusted
	Rise of the gold standard
	Grant did not get a majority of white votes in 1868, and questionable in 1872
		He was in office because of the republican freedmen
		This is a reason for the republicans in the north to encourage freedmen to vote
	Establishment of Department of Justice
		Appointment of Ackermann to ensure enforcement of passed laws
		Limited success because of Jury system

15th amendment
	Everyone can vote - Meaning freedmen but not women
	Splits women's right movement into two factions
		National Women's Suffrage Association
			Opposed because it didn't include women
		Equal Rights Association (or something)
			Saw it as a step towards women's rights? (I didn't catch it)
	Ratified in 1870

Freedman's Bureau continues until expiration in 1872
	By 1869, supporting 4000 schools in South to teach illiterate former slaves
		Mainly in towns, not in rural area where agricultural freedmen are

Freedmen in south only have majority once, and not for long.
	Why, then, does reconstruction fail?
		Republican coalition doesn't hold together
		When taxes need to be raised, people don't go with it

Ku Klux Klan

KKK Bills - force bills
	Allows Grant to establish martial control in counties that are considered out of control

Increasing in sharecropping
	Mainly in the heavy black counties

Price of cotton dropped because of exzternal sources (Egypt, India, etc)

1874 Split in Republican party allows Democrats to retake control in congress

Merriam v Moody's Executors (1868)
	Dillon's Rule
	States have authority over subsidiaries such as counties, towns, cities, etc

Election of 1872
	Knave vs Fool
	Grant doesn't campaign while Greeley does, but Greeley dies between election and inauguration
	So what do his electors do? They scatter their votes all over the place.

Patenberg, NJ race riots - 10/12/1872

Election of 1876
	Only three states still under Republican government
	Republicans nominate the governor of Ohio - Rutherford B. Hayes
	Two sets of electoral votes come from the three southern states
		Congress has no idea what to do with these
		They seem to come from Democratic violence
		If Hayes gets all of them, he wins, but otherwise he loses
		Mass lawyer sent south
		Impending threat of recurring civil war
		Congress forms a comittee
		A good mix of republicans and democrats
		Compromise of 1876/1877 (occurs in '77)
			Hayes will be the president, but Republicans remove troops from the south
			A southerner will be brought into the cabinet for a key position
			This is done
		Rate of lynchings goes down because Democrats have control of the states now
