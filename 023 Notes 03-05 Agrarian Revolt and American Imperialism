Southern Alliance
	Two ideas:
		Rural cooperative bank
		Set up a government subtreasury to buy up farmer's crops
	Never works well because farmers don't have capital to set up the bank
People's Party / Populist Party
	Rises up out of the Southern Alliance
	Working for workers
	Platform
		Graduated income tax
		Restrictions on immigration
		Sub-reasury for crop sales
		Secret ballot
			Referendum and Recall
		Direct election of senators
		Postal savings bank
		Unrestrained silver coinage (16:1)
		Goernment railroads and telegraph
		No subsidy to any business
		Abolish Pinkertons
	Do well in the high plains
	Not so much in the midwest
	Gets a substantial number of votes, but no attraction to the midwest
	Rises and then falls around 1900
Economic Collapse
	Starts when a railroad can't make bond payments
	Builds on the crash of a big bank in London
	People start cashing in their bond and share holdings
	Because there is an excess of silver and the set 16:1 ratio, people ask for gold.
	The gold supplies are dwindling
	Crime of '93 - Cancel the Sherman Silver Purchase Act (required the government to purchase more silver)
	1894 - A third are unemployed and most of the rest are underemployed
	Worst crash so far.
Coxey's Army
	Coxey was a successful businessman
	Move to deliver a petition to Washington on Easter Sunday
	Hoards of police are assembled
	When he walks onto the grass he's arrested for trespassing.
	The petition disappears until later
Lower tariff bill - 1894
	Wilson-Goram Tariff - gets 600 amendments: exemptions, etc
		Reduces tariff slightly
	Put in a 2\% income tax. 1895 it gets overturned
	Not until 16th amendment until
Election of 1894
	Worst democrat defeat ever
	Only one democrat wins the polls - John Fitzgerald
