	Especially black civil rights are sitting still
	Women, Blacks, and Native Americans have a few openings, but couldn't really take advantage of them
	Many people still feel that women belong in the household

		USS Panay
			One of five small US gunboats
			Attacked without warning by Japanese aircraft
			Completely helpless

				Japan claims a mistake even though it was flying American colors
				Provide a bit of compensation, but the US doesn't really do anything about it
			In the aftermath, a large majority of the US public is unwilling to take action against Japan for this
