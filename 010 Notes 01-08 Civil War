Secession begins 1860-1861
	South Carolina first
	Border states don't go yet
Some motion for peaceful separation
	They'll need to trade cotton, anyway
United States vs Merriman (1861)
	Merriman wins, but...
	Abraham Lincoln does nothing in response to case
Border Ruffians
	Quantrill
	"Bloodly Bill" Anderson
	Both are lionized by southerners
North has overwhelming resource advantage
	But the war goes on for a while
	North also has population advantage, as well as immigration
	200k former slaves
	Sparse railroads in the south
	Can't move around the resources, so they start to starve in 1863
South passes a conscription act
	Effective July 1862
	A year ahead of the Union
	Permits buyouts
	Exempts Gov't
	Exempts people who have 20 slaves or more
Selling of bonds
	Printing money to inflate money
	South has no credibility, oops
	Nearly 90% of the specie is in the north
	North makes its money legal tender (so they can use it to pay public debts)
	South can't do that because states don't want interference
	Southern money barely works
	Northern 25\% tax on state printed money
	By the end of the war, North has 80\% inflation, while south has 9000\% inflation
