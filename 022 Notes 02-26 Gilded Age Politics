Question: How could the founding fathers' government cope with this massively different society?
In this time period, all the elections are very close
	No president gets more than 1% lead on popular vote
	Two presidents win without popular majority
	House and senate usually controlled by opposite parties
	Republicans wave the red flag
		Parade that they won the civil war
	High election participation in the time period
	Civil war loyalties are intense
Everyone operating on trying to maximize personal profit
	Miners want to get everything to be coined
	Gold ratio of 16:1 (gold:silver)
	But the mining industry screws this up
	Generally, the supply of silver increases faster than the supply of gold until the discovery of the Klondike
Reconstruction dies
Currently no national bank, but there is bank regulation

Rutherford B. Hayes
	Regarded as a fraud
	Declares he will only serve one term
		Decreases his effectiveness
	Passes Coinage Act
		Only coins gold
		Known later as the crime of '73
	Bland Allison Act passed
		Requires the US to purchase a certain amount of silver
		Makes silver miners happy
		Passed over veto
	New legislation passed
		Makes sure that the silver bought doesn't need to be coined
	Decides to deal with corruption that has built up
		Conflict with Roscoe Conkling
		Standoff between government and private powers

Since Hayes isn't running, election of 1880 is wide open
	Democrats turn to Godkin
	Move in Republican party to get Grant back in office
		Reformists pull out all the stops to block Grant
		Turn to Garfield
	Election is reasonably close
	Garfield wins
		Gets assassinated

Chester Arthur becomes president of the US
	Chinese exclusion act gets passed over his veto in 1883
	Passes the first significant Naval support bill

1883 Pendleton Civil Service Act
	Arthur signs and supports it
	Originally only applies to about 12\% of the employees
	Allows the president to expand the classes of workers who get covered
	Each outgoing president from here on will turn several of his people into civil servants
	By 1900, 40\% of the employees will be covered
	Hiring done by merit

Election of 1884
	Grover Cleveland
		Competant politician
		Will do pretty much anything required
	Because of the candidates' histories, this is one of the dirtiest elections ever (in terms of political techniques)
	William Tecumseh Sherman offered the nomination
		Issues a Sherman - Will not run, will not serve
		Very definitive
	Cleveland wins a narrow victory

Cleveland ``accomplishes two things''
	One is a marriage
	Other is backing more naval funding
