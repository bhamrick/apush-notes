Korea is opened by the United States
Spanish American War
	After detonation of the Maine (In Havanna Harbor), US opinion is in favor of evicting Spain from Cuba
	McKinley attempts a hold on public opinion, having seen war
	Yellow press drives into war along with two other events
		McKinley sends an investigator down to see how things are
			The report is devastating
			Shows horrible photographs
			Also reports that the ship was blown up by an external explosion
				Probably an honest escape
				Not until much later that it's clear that it might have been an internal explosion
	US wins every battle
	War lasts about 100 days

Imperialism
	US acquires several ``possessions'' overseas and massive influence
	This splits the country and congress into Imperialists and Anti-Imperialists
	What to do with the possessions?
		Guam and Wake are not really noticed. Put military governors in every now and then.
		Puerto Rico had been promised a better deal by Spain
			Put in a military governer and built it up
			More or less accepts the admission into the US
			Not technically US citizens
			Nonvoting representative in congres
			All US laws apply to Puerto Rico
			Leads to court cases - does the tariff apply?
				Insular cases
				Rules that the Puerto Ricans don't quite have all the rights of citizens
			1917 when WWI has broken out, the Jones Act makes them citizens
			Organized territory of the United States
		Platt Amendment
			Sort of rejects the Teller Amendment
		Taft report
			Should set up an indigenous goernment in the Philippines while pouring in infrastructural support
			The US will follow this tactic.
			Will eventually move Philippines to full independence.
